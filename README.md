# tSNE
Implementation and comparison of a basic version of a t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) with a Principal component analysis (PCA) in Python

**Note:**
- 3 random datasets
- scikit-learn is used to implement the tSNE and PCA
- comparison of training and test accuracy between CNN and ANN (plots over time)
- comparison of 3 different values for the perplexity parameter of tSNE
- total 3 PCA + 3x3 tSNE tSNE plots = 12 plots
